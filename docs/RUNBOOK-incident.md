# Runbook — incidents

Decision matrix for things going wrong. Pick the row that matches the
symptom; cross-reference the linked runbook for the recovery procedure.

## Decision matrix

| Symptom | Likely cause | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Single client URI leaked / device lost | Per-device | `RUNBOOK-rotate.md` § 1; record via `make audit-log-append ACTION=revoke-client CLIENT=…` |
| REALITY private key leaked | Server-wide | `RUNBOOK-rotate.md` § 2, then reissue every client |
| Subscription URL leaked publicly | Token | add the leaked token to `subscription.revoked_tokens`, run `make deploy`; reissue via `make issue-bootstrap CLIENT=… --expires DATE` |
| Bootstrap URL leaked before client fetched | Token | re-issue with `make issue-bootstrap CLIENT=… --expires DATE` (old token returns 410 on first GET) |
| TLS handshake to VPS fails from many networks | IP burned | `make burn-check` confirms; warm-spare → `make promote-spare OTP=…` (if pre-provisioned), else blue-green to new ASN |
| Slow / lossy on one network only, fine elsewhere | Routing / ISP-specific | try Hysteria2 fallback; if persistent, blue-green to different region; for the RU home-ISP TLS-policing rule run `make test-tls-policing HOST=…` then flip the cohort to `xray_flow_mode: mux` |
| `xray run -test -config` fails after deploy | Config bug | `RUNBOOK-rollback.md` § 1 (config rollback, automatic via handler rescue); `make drift-since-tag` shows what changed since last known-good |
| New Xray release crashes / leaks | Binary | `RUNBOOK-rollback.md` § 2 (binary rollback) |
| watchdog alerts with `class=active_probing` | TSPU probing wave | `make probing-summary` for the rollup; enable `vpn.enable_probe_ratelimit` if not already; nothing to do server-side beyond observe |
| watchdog alerts with `class=tcp_listen_wedge` | Xray hung | `systemctl restart xray`; if recurring, check `vpn.xray_flow_mode` cohort match |
| watchdog alerts with `class=nginx_403_spike` | Probe/scrape wave | usually benign; if rate climbs, `make check-ip-reputation` to see if IP appeared on a public blocklist |
| `make asn-drift` alert | Provider IP reassignment | check `docs/PROVIDER-NOTES.md` — if new ASN is in Avoid tier, blue-green now |
| `make check-ip-reputation` alert | IP on Spamhaus / optional FireHOL netset | blue-green or wait out the listing depending on which list and severity score |
| Operator workstation compromised | Operator | rotate SSH key + age key + REALITY key + restic password; full credential rotation; `make audit-log` shows every issuance from the compromised workstation |
| Lost SSH access (key deleted) | Operator | see § "Lost SSH access" below |
| Lost SOPS age private key | Operator | see § "Lost age key" below; if Shamir-split (`docs/AGE-RECOVERY.md`) or YubiKey-backed (`docs/SECRETS.md`), reconstruct first |
| Lost Terraform state file | Operator | see § "State loss" below |
| 3x-ui / Marzban / Remnawave panel exposed | Architecture deviation | this stack has no panel by design; if you added one, take it offline NOW |
| Suspected RKN / TSPU active probing | Threat-model | `make probing-summary` for class breakdown; rerun `make validate-target` for SNI hygiene; consider rotating SNI target; check honeypot textfile metrics |
| TSPU rule-set drift suspected | Threat-model | `make tspu-canary` from an in-cohort RU test client (diff vs yesterday) |
| Mobile network whitelist rolled out for the operator | Threat-model | P3 reachability — automation can't help; switch network (roaming, fixed broadband) or stand up an in-country relay |

## Lost SSH access

You don't have the private key matching `admin_ssh_public_key` on the VPS.

UpCloud:

1. Console → server → Open Web Console → log in as `deploy` (with the
   password you don't have) → impossible.
2. Console → server → Power off → Boot from rescue ISO → mount root disk →
   edit `/home/deploy/.ssh/authorized_keys` → add a new public key.
3. Boot back to disk; SSH in with the new key.
4. Once in, `make rotate-credentials` (technically just push the new key
   via tfvars + ansible playbook) and never use the rescue key again.

If you cannot use rescue, the only path is destroy and recreate the VPS
with a new tfvars `admin_ssh_public_key`. Secrets and Terraform state are
unaffected — `make plan apply inventory wait deploy verify` rebuilds.

## Lost age key

The SOPS secrets file is unrecoverable.

If you encrypted to multiple recipients (recommended for teams), use the
other operator's age key. `sops` tries each recipient until one succeeds.

If you didn't, treat this as a **complete credential leak**:

1. Provision a fresh VPS (new IP, ideally different ASN).
2. Generate a new age keypair, fresh REALITY keypair, fresh per-client
   UUIDs / shortIds / passwords / peer keys, fresh restic password.
3. Distribute new client URIs to every device.
4. Decommission the old VPS once every device has switched.

The encrypted SOPS blob may still be holding valid secrets in storage. age
is computationally hard but not future-proof. Don't keep the old blob
around.

## State loss

Terraform's local state is the only record of which UpCloud resources
belong to this deployment. Lose it and:

- `terraform plan` shows everything as "needs creating".
- `terraform destroy` does nothing (no resources to destroy).
- `make rollback-…` blue-green flows still work but become manual (you
  edit the UpCloud console / API directly).

Recovery path 0 — restore from `make backup-state` snapshot (preferred):

```bash
# State backups live in ~/.config/vpn-provision/state-backups/<provider>-<env>-<timestamp>.tfstate.age
LATEST=$(ls -1t ~/.config/vpn-provision/state-backups/upcloud-prod-*.tfstate.age | head -1)
age -d -i ~/.config/vpn-provision/age.key \
    -o terraform/providers/upcloud/terraform.tfstate \
    "$LATEST"
chmod 0600 terraform/providers/upcloud/terraform.tfstate

terraform -chdir=terraform/providers/upcloud plan
# Expect: no changes
```

Recovery path 1 — state was committed on a partner workstation:

```bash
# Copy the state file back to where Terraform expects it
cp ~/team-shared/vpn-prod-terraform.tfstate \
   terraform/providers/upcloud/terraform.tfstate
```

Recovery path 2 — re-import the existing VPS:

```bash
cd terraform/providers/upcloud
terraform init
terraform import upcloud_server.vpn <SERVER_UUID>
terraform import upcloud_firewall_rules.vpn <SERVER_UUID>
# Validate state matches reality
terraform plan       # should show no changes
```

Find `<SERVER_UUID>` in the UpCloud console (server details → "ID").

After restoration, **back up the state file out of band** (encrypted USB,
1Password Documents, age-encrypted in the same recipient as your
secrets). Don't lose it twice.

## Suspected compromise of the VPS

If you suspect the running VPS has been compromised at the OS level (root
escalation, persistent attacker, unknown process):

1. **Do not** SSH in to "look around" — every observation gives the
   attacker a chance to exfiltrate or alter logs.
2. Power off the VPS via the UpCloud API/console.
3. Snapshot the disk for forensic analysis (UpCloud has a snapshot
   feature; export to a separate region if you can).
4. Treat every credential the VPS could touch as compromised: REALITY
   private key, Hysteria server cert, AWG server private key, restic
   password, every client UUID/password/peer that was on it.
5. Provision a fresh VPS, full credential rotation.
6. Forensic the snapshot offline.

The "disposable nodes" property of this stack means step 5 is fast: it's
the same procedure as a normal first-time deploy.
