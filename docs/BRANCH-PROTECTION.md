# Branch protection

`main` should require every CI gate to pass before merge, plus a
CODEOWNERS review and a linear history. The default `GITHUB_TOKEN` does
**not** carry `Administration: write`, so the protection rule is applied
through `.github/workflows/branch-protection.yml`, gated on a
fine-grained personal access token (PAT).

## One-time setup

### 1. Create the PAT

GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens →
**Fine-grained tokens** → Generate new token.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Token name | `vpn-deploy branch-protection` |
| Expiration | 1 year (set a reminder) |
| Repository access | Only the `vpn-deploy` repository |
| Repository permissions → Administration | **Read and write** |
| Repository permissions → Contents | Read |

Other permissions stay at default (no access). Save the token.

### 2. Save the token as a repo secret

GitHub → repo Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository
secret:

- Name: `BRANCH_PROTECTION_TOKEN`
- Value: paste the PAT

### 3. Run the workflow

GitHub → Actions → **branch-protection** → Run workflow → leave default
(`main`) → Run.

Verify it succeeded; the job logs should print the required-status-check
count (currently 28).

### 4. Verify in Settings

Settings → Branches → `main` → see:

- Require a pull request before merging ✅
- Require approvals (1) ✅
- Dismiss stale pull request approvals ✅
- Require review from Code Owners ✅
- Require status checks to pass before merging ✅
- 28 status checks listed
- Require branches to be up to date before merging ✅
- Require conversation resolution before merging ✅
- Require linear history ✅
- Do not allow force pushes ✅
- Do not allow deletions ✅

## Required status checks (must match CI job names exactly)

| Workflow | Job name |
|---|---|
| ci.yml | `gitleaks` |
| ci.yml | `terraform fmt + validate (upcloud)` |
| ci.yml | `terraform fmt + validate (hetzner)` |
| ci.yml | `terraform fmt + validate (vultr)` |
| ci.yml | `cloud-init schema` |
| ci.yml | `ansible-lint + syntax-check` |
| ci.yml | `molecule (baseline)` |
| ci.yml | `molecule (firewall)` |
| ci.yml | `molecule (xray)` |
| ci.yml | `molecule (hysteria)` |
| ci.yml | `molecule (nginx-xhttp)` |
| ci.yml | `molecule (watchdog)` |
| ci.yml | `molecule (monitoring)` |
| ci.yml | `molecule (backup)` |
| ci.yml | `molecule (subscription-host)` |
| ci.yml | `shellcheck` |
| ci.yml | `secrets-coverage` |
| ci.yml | `templates-render` |
| ci.yml | `yamllint` |
| ci.yml | `pytest unit tests` |
| ci.yml | `jinja snapshot diff` |
| ci.yml | `secrets schema (lenient on example)` |
| ci.yml | `terraform test (upcloud)` |
| ci.yml | `terraform test (hetzner)` |
| ci.yml | `terraform test (vultr)` |
| ci.yml | `molecule failure (watchdog)` |
| codeql.yml | `codeql (python)` |
| codeql.yml | `codeql (actions)` |

If you rename a CI job, update both the matrix in this workflow and the
`CONTEXTS` list in `branch-protection.yml`. Otherwise GitHub treats the
old name as a "missing" required check and the merge is blocked
indefinitely.

## Why not just enable it in Settings?

You can. The workflow exists so the rule is **codified** — the next
operator checking out the repo sees what protection is meant to be
applied without having to read the org admin's mind. Re-running the
workflow reasserts the rule, which is useful after CI matrix changes.

## Re-running after a CI matrix change

1. Update `CONTEXTS` in `.github/workflows/branch-protection.yml`.
2. Update the table above.
3. Push.
4. After CI is green on `main`, run the **branch-protection** workflow.

## Informational (NOT required)

These run but don't gate merge:

- `markdown-link-check` (lychee)
- `scorecard` (OSSF)
- `release-please` (writes the release PR; isn't a check)

Adding them to required would block on transient external service
failures (link rot, OSSF rate limits) and slow merges without quality
benefit.
