# Runbook — rollback

Three rollback levels. Pick the smallest one that fixes the failure.

## Level 1 — config rollback (handler rescue, automatic)

The `xray` role's `Restart xray` handler has `block:` / `rescue:`. If a
new config fails `xray run -test -config` or doesn't come up active
within 5 retries × 2s, the handler:

1. Restores `/etc/xray/config.json.prev`
2. Restarts xray
3. Fails the play

You'll see `Xray restart failed; previous config was restored if
available.` in the Ansible output. The host is back on the previous
config. Investigate the bad template, fix it, re-deploy.

If automatic rescue didn't fire (e.g., the bad change was outside the
xray template — say nftables), trigger the manual playbook:

```bash
ansible-playbook ansible/playbooks/rollback-config.yml
```

It restores `/etc/xray/config.json.prev` → validates → restarts.

## Level 2 — binary rollback

Use when a new Xray pinned version misbehaves (slow, leaks, crashes).
Previous releases stay in `/opt/xray/releases/<version>/`; only the
`current` symlink points at the active one.

```bash
# Find the previous release
ssh deploy@<vps> ls /opt/xray/releases

# Roll the symlink back
make rollback-xray ROLLBACK_XRAY_VERSION=v26.3.27
```

The playbook validates the existing config against the rolled-back
binary, restarts, and verifies `is-active`.

To make the rollback permanent, also update `xray.version` and
`xray.linux_*_sha256` in secrets back to the rolled-back version, so
future `make deploy` runs don't re-pull the broken release.

## Level 3 — blue-green VPS replacement

Use when the host itself is the problem: IP burned, kernel panic loop,
hypervisor outage, or you suspect compromise.

```bash
# 1. Bring up a green node alongside blue. Use a different server_name in tfvars
#    (e.g., vpn-prod-fi2 instead of vpn-prod-fi1) so they coexist. You'll have
#    to drop or temporarily relax `prevent_destroy` on blue if you want
#    Terraform to manage both — easiest is a separate ENV value:
ENV=green make plan apply inventory wait dry-run deploy verify

# 2. Test green with a real client.

# 3. Switch DNS / floating IP / subscription URL to green. If clients use bare
#    IP, reissue subscriptions — they'll need the new IP anyway.

# 4. Drain blue: keep it alive 24-72 hours so any cached client connections
#    can fail over to green's URI on next reconnect.

# 5. Destroy blue:
ENV=prod   terraform -chdir=terraform/providers/upcloud destroy
# (You'll need to remove `prevent_destroy = true` first — by design.)
```

If you have a UpCloud floating IP attached to blue, transfer it to green
in the UpCloud console (or via API), and the IP-bound clients reconnect
without reissuing.

## What blocks rollback

- **Lost Terraform state** — without state, Terraform doesn't know about
  blue. You can `terraform import` to recover, but it's manual. See
  `RUNBOOK-incident.md` § "State loss".
- **Lost SOPS secrets** — without secrets, you can't redeploy onto green.
  Restore from out-of-band backup of the SOPS file or treat as full
  rotation event.
- **Single shared subscription URL** — if every client uses the same
  bare-IP URL, switching IPs requires reissuing every URL. Move to
  per-device subscription tokens (see `subscription-host` role) to make
  this a non-event.

## When to skip rollback and rotate instead

- If the failure is "REALITY private key suspected leaked" or "operator
  workstation compromised", rollback is wrong — you need rotation. See
  `RUNBOOK-rotate.md`.
- If the failure is "IP got blocklisted by ASN", rollback to a previous
  config doesn't help. Blue-green to a new VPS in a different ASN.
