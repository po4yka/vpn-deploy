# Subscription plane — gap matrix

Source: `censorship-bypass/wikis/infrastructure-operations/wiki/synthesis/subscription-delivery-plane-2026`.

This document compares the wiki's recommended subscription-delivery
architecture against what `roles/subscription-host` actually ships, so
the gap is visible and the next iteration has a backlog.

## Architecture target (wiki)

```
Control plane (Terraform + Ansible + secrets)
  └─ renders scoped per-device payloads
       └─ Delivery host (separate from VPN node)
            ├─ public HTTPS endpoint:
            │    /s/<opaque-token>
            │    /bootstrap/<one-time-token>
            ├─ stores: token hashes, scopes, expiry; encrypted payloads
            └─ does NOT store: REALITY privateKey, provider tokens,
                               deploy SSH keys, master subscription
```

Key principle: a subscription URL is a **bearer secret** (RFC 6750),
so it must be issued, scoped, expirable, and revocable.

## Gap matrix

| Property | Wiki target | This repo today | Gap |
|---|---|---|---|
| Per-device opaque token | required | partial — one token per `clients[*]` | ✓ shape OK |
| Token stored as hash, not plaintext | required | plaintext in SOPS-encrypted secrets | secrets are encrypted at rest but the host serves plaintext payloads keyed by plaintext tokens |
| One-time bootstrap URL | required | `/bootstrap/<token>` via vpn-bootstrap service | ✓ shipped |
| Scoped payload (per-device profile only) | required | per-device with shared server params | ✓ partial |
| HTTPS endpoint with no access log of paths | required | `access_log off` on `/sub/` and `/bootstrap/` | ✓ shipped |
| Revocation list | implemented in v1.2 | `subscription.revoked_tokens` | ✓ shipped |
| Rate-limit | implemented in v1.2 | `subscription.rate_limit` + burst | ✓ shipped |
| Token expiry per device | required | `<token>.meta` sidecar (ISO date or epoch); vpn-bootstrap returns 410 after `expires`. Works for BOTH /sub/ and /bootstrap/. | ✓ shipped |
| Delivery host separate from VPN node | required | `vpn_subscription_only` inventory var skips every transport role; pairs with multi-operator SOPS split | ✓ shipped (see `docs/SUBSCRIPTION-HOST-SEPARATION.md`) |
| QR bootstrap flow | required | `issue-bootstrap.sh --qr` + `issue-sub-token.sh --qr` writes a PNG | ✓ shipped |
| Audit log of token reads | recommended | `/var/log/vpn-subscription/reads.log` JSONL; one record per read (consumed/unknown/revoked/expired) with hash prefix + src_ip + bytes; pull via `make sub-reads` | ✓ shipped |
| Hashed token storage | recommended | disk paths use `<route>/<sha256(token)>`; plaintext token never on disk | ✓ shipped |
| No `Referer` / no `cache` | required | explicit `Cache-Control: no-store` + `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer` on both `/sub/` and `/bootstrap/` | ✓ shipped |

## What to ship next

The eight items previously on the "ship next" list are now landed —
the gap matrix above is at parity with the wiki spec. Remaining work
is operational rather than architectural:

1. **Periodic rotation of `/sub/` tokens** — even with expiry,
   long-lived /sub/ URLs accumulate trust over time. A scheduled
   re-issue cadence (e.g. quarterly) trims the leak window. Not
   currently automated; `make issue-sub-token CLIENT=… --refresh-
   token <existing-token>` does the manual operation.
2. **`make sub-reads` aggregation** — the read-audit log is JSONL
   and grep-friendly today; a small summary script (top-pulling
   tokens, geographic clustering of src_ip, rate spikes) would help
   forensics. Compose from `jq` + existing tooling for v1.
3. **Multi-region delivery host** — `vpn_subscription_only` covers
   the single-host separation case. A multi-region delivery fleet
   (different ASN, geo-distributed) is the next step; the existing
   `fleet-rotate` orchestrator can drive it once the inventory
   pattern is documented.

## What is NOT a gap

These are documented design choices, not gaps:

- No HTML rendering on subscription endpoints. Wiki agrees.
- No JavaScript on subscription endpoints. Wiki agrees.
- No browser-style cookies. Wiki agrees.
- Plain static payload, no API. Wiki tolerates this as a v1 shape.
