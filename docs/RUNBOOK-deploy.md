# Runbook — deploy

Two flows: **first-time deploy** (handled by `QUICKSTART.md`) and
**re-deploy after editing configs** (this runbook).

## Re-deploy after a config or secrets edit

When you've edited a role template, group_vars, or the secrets file, and
want to push the change to an existing VPS:

```bash
export ANSIBLE_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE=~/.ssh/vpn_deploy
make decrypt           # /tmp/vpn-prod.secrets.yaml
make validate          # gitleaks + lint must pass
make dry-run           # ansible --check --diff — read every changed line
make deploy
make verify
make clean
```

If `dry-run` shows changes you didn't expect, **stop**. Investigate.
Don't push. The most common cause is a forgotten edit on a different
branch, or a role that's accidentally redownloading the binary because
the version pin moved.

## Re-deploy after a Terraform change (instance type, zone, firewall)

```bash
make plan              # READ THE PLAN
# If it shows "destroy and recreate" on the server, STOP — that's
# infrastructure rollback, not config rollback. See RUNBOOK-rollback.md
# § "blue-green replacement".
make apply             # only if the plan was non-destructive
make inventory
make wait
make deploy
make verify
```

`prevent_destroy = true` on `upcloud_server` blocks accidental destruction
in `terraform apply`. To deliberately destroy, drop that lifecycle block
in a feature branch.

## Add a new client device

```bash
SOPS_FILE=~/.config/vpn-provision/prod.secrets.sops.yaml \
./scripts/new-client.sh --emit-uri laptop

make decrypt
make rotate-credentials      # re-renders xray/hysteria/awg configs
make verify
make clean
```

Hand the AmneziaWG private key (printed by the script) to the device
through a secure channel. Wipe it from your terminal scrollback.

## Selective deploy with tags

```bash
# Just push a config-only change to xray
ansible-playbook ansible/playbooks/site.yml --tags xray

# Just refresh nftables
ansible-playbook ansible/playbooks/site.yml --tags firewall

# Just re-render fallback transports
ansible-playbook ansible/playbooks/site.yml --tags transport
```

The `tags:` field on each role in `playbooks/site.yml` enumerates what's
selectable. `always` tags (`baseline`, `firewall`) run regardless.

## Staging first

```bash
ENV=staging make plan apply inventory wait dry-run deploy verify
# Test with a real client from a representative network
ENV=prod    make plan apply inventory wait dry-run deploy verify
```

Staging uses a different VPS, different REALITY keypair, different SNI
target, and ideally a different operator SSH key. Don't ever test new
Xray pre-release builds against prod users.

## What "verify" actually checks

`ansible/playbooks/verify.yml` asserts:

- cloud-init bootstrap marker present
- nftables config syntactically valid
- Xray config valid (`xray run -test -config`) and service active
- TCP/443 listening
- nginx -t passes (if P1 enabled)
- Hysteria service active and UDP/443 listening (if P2 UDP enabled)
- AmneziaWG interface up (if P2 AWG enabled)
- SSH refuses passwords and root login

If any of these fail, `make verify` exits non-zero. Don't sign off on a
deploy until verify is green.
