# Provider notes

## ASN / hoster risk tiers (RU threat model, 2026-05)

Source: `censorship-bypass/wikis/infrastructure-operations/wiki/concepts/server-anti-detection-checklist-2026`
and the TCP-freeze observation in `tspu-dpi-internals/wiki/concepts/tcp-connection-freezing`.

| Tier | Provider / ASN | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Avoid | Cloudflare AS13335 | TSPU peering at DME/KJA/LED; 8–16 KB cut; see `CDN-DECISION.md` |
| Avoid | OVH AS16276, Hetzner AS24940, DigitalOcean AS14061 | "Foreign datacenter" ASN bucket triggers TCP freeze (~14–25 KB on mobile RU) |
| Avoid | JustHost AS26383, VDSina AS216071 | Frequently flagged as VPN-tenant ranges; high churn |
| Acceptable | UpCloud (current primary) | Not on the public RKN/TSPU watch lists as of 2026-05; verify ASN before rollout |
| Preferred | Hostkey, nuxt.cloud (DE/NL), hostvds.com (FI) | Smaller, less-flagged ranges per community testing |

For a full deploy this primarily affects the **egress** IP, not the
ingress: a node that ingresses on REALITY/TCP and egresses through the
same VPS IP will hit the TCP-freeze rule when the upstream is on one of
the "Avoid" ASNs. Split-hop egress (separate exit IP, e.g. via WARP) is
documented in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` once that role lands.

## UpCloud (primary, v1)

UpCloud is the primary provider in v1. Resource shape:

- `upcloud_server` — the VPS itself, with `template { … }` cloning a public
  storage template UUID into the root disk.
- `upcloud_firewall_rules` — attached to the server. Note that UpCloud's
  firewall is on the hypervisor, not the OS — so even if `nftables` is
  misconfigured, UpCloud's rules apply first.
- `network_interface { type = "public" }` + `{ type = "utility" }` are
  required for the server to be reachable; `private` interfaces are
  optional for multi-VPS networking (out of scope for v1).
- Daily snapshots are enabled in `template.backup_rule` (7-day retention).
  This is a hypervisor-level safety net **separate from** restic backups,
  which contain the configs you can restore onto a fresh VPS.

### Useful UpCloud zones for EU baseline

- `fi-hel1` — Helsinki (default in `prod.tfvars.example`)
- `de-fra1` — Frankfurt
- `nl-ams1` — Amsterdam
- `pl-waw1` — Warsaw

#### Zone selection by client cohort

Zone choice is primarily a routing-quality decision, with a secondary
attribution-risk axis. The combination of the IP's prefix-history
weight and the geographic distance to the cohort matters more than the
nominal latency number.

| Cohort | Recommended | Avoid | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| RU mobile (MTS / MegaFon / Beeline) | `fi-hel1`, `de-fra1` | `nl-ams1`, `pl-waw1` | NL/PL ranges historically take more probing waves; FI/DE peering through KSC/Stockholm carries fewer flagged prefixes |
| RU home ISP (Rostelecom / MTS-broadband) | `de-fra1`, `fi-hel1` | `nl-ams1` | DE-Internet-Exchange peers directly with RU upstreams; lower-jitter for XHTTP/Hysteria |
| RU mobile under TLS-policing rule (~12-conn home-ISP block) | `de-fra1` + `xray_flow_mode: mux` | any single-zone deploy | The policing rule is independent of zone; mitigation is the cohort-level mux flag (see `docs/MULTI-COHORT.md`), not the zone |
| EU-resident operator testing | `nl-ams1`, `pl-waw1` | n/a | Closer for development; not the same threat surface as production cohorts |
| Mixed-cohort fleet | two zones in different countries | one zone | Splitting across `fi-hel1` + `de-fra1` (or +`nl-ams1`) gives the warm-spare (`docs/`-flow `make watch-spare` / `make promote-spare`) something to promote to without sharing a peering point |

After the zone is picked, validate the actual ASN that UpCloud assigns
your VPS prefix:

```bash
make probe-asn HOST=$(terraform -chdir=terraform/providers/upcloud output -raw server_ipv4)
```

If the returned ASN is in the "Avoid" tier from the table at the top of
this document, blue-green immediately to a new IP in the same zone or
move to a different zone. Don't deploy clients against an IP whose ASN
shows up on the TCP-freeze list.

### Storage template UUIDs

UpCloud rotates template UUIDs as new minor versions ship. Always pin a
specific UUID in `tfvars`, never a slug. List candidates with:

```bash
upctl storage list --public --template
```

Pick the most recent Debian 13 or Ubuntu 24.04 minimal cloud image.

### Provider auth

```bash
export UPCLOUD_USERNAME='vpn-deploy'   # sub-account, not master
export UPCLOUD_PASSWORD='…'
```

Use a sub-account with only the rights this stack needs. Never bake
credentials into `*.tfvars` — the provider reads them from env.

### Limits to be aware of

- Hypervisor firewall has a per-server rule cap. The base 5–7 rules from
  `firewall.tf` are well within it; if you add per-CIDR carve-outs to the
  point of dozens, watch the cap.
- Object storage / "Managed Database" features are out of scope here.
- API rate limit: low, but Terraform's default backoff handles it.

## Hetzner (v1.1)

Uses:

- `hcloud_server`, `hcloud_ssh_key`, `hcloud_firewall`,
  `hcloud_firewall_attachment`, and optional `hcloud_floating_ip`
  for the honeypot secondary IPv4.
- ASN AS24940 — flagged in the TCP-freeze rule on RU mobile networks
  (see the "Avoid" tier above). Hetzner remains useful for non-RU-mobile
  cohorts and for development; rotate IPs more aggressively than UpCloud.
- Cheaper than UpCloud per spec; smaller geographic surface (EU-heavy +
  US East/West, no APAC).
- IPv6 is enabled by default via `enable_ipv6 = true`; set it false in
  `tfvars` only for regions or plans where you explicitly do not want it.
- Credentials come from `HCLOUD_TOKEN`.

## Vultr (v1.1)

Uses:

- `vultr_instance`, `vultr_ssh_key`, `vultr_firewall_group`,
  `vultr_firewall_rule`, and optional `vultr_instance_ipv4`
  for the honeypot secondary IPv4.
- Wider region coverage than UpCloud / Hetzner.
- IP reputation is more variable; rotate regions when burn-check shows
  a region's prefix is RKN-blocked.
- The provider schema requires an API key in provider config. This root maps
  sensitive variable `vultr_api_key`; export `TF_VAR_vultr_api_key` instead
  of writing tokens into tfvars.

## What every provider root must export for inventory compatibility

`scripts/render-inventory.sh` reads exactly these Terraform outputs:

- `server_ipv4` — required
- `server_ipv6` — optional, may be `null`
- `honeypot_ipv4` — optional, may be `null`
- `admin_user` — required
- `server_hostname` — required

Provider roots that don't export these names will need a parallel branch in
the script. Keep the names identical to avoid that.
