# Runbook — disaster recovery / restore

The architecture targets **15–30 minute restore** from a clean operator
workstation back to a fully functional VPN node. Two paths.

## What you need

- The repo (git clone — public).
- The encrypted SOPS secrets file (`~/.config/vpn-provision/prod.secrets.sops.yaml`).
- Your age private key (`~/.config/vpn-provision/age.key`).
- The Terraform state file (or willingness to `terraform import` an
  existing VPS).
- Optional: a recent restic snapshot from the old VPS, if you want to
  restore configs verbatim instead of re-rendering from secrets.

## Path A — full rebuild from scratch (recommended)

This is the path the architecture is designed for. Don't restore configs;
rebuild them deterministically from secrets and templates.

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo on a clean operator workstation
git clone <repo> ~/GitRep/vpn-deploy
cd ~/GitRep/vpn-deploy

# 2. Restore your age key + SOPS file
mkdir -p ~/.config/vpn-provision
# (copy from your encrypted backup / hardware key / 1Password)

# 3. Provision a fresh VPS — possibly in a different ASN if the old one burned
$EDITOR terraform/providers/upcloud/environments/prod.tfvars
make init plan apply inventory wait

# 4. Deploy
make decrypt
make dry-run
make deploy
make verify
make clean
```

You're done. The new VPS has identical service surface to the old one
(same Xray version, same nginx config shape, same Hysteria policy, same
AWG peers), generated from the same secrets file. Clients reconnect with
their existing URIs (which encode UUIDs/passwords, not IPs — assuming
you used DNS or floating IP).

If clients used bare IP, reissue URIs with `scripts/new-client.sh
--emit-uri <name>` against each client name.

## Path B — restore from restic snapshot

Use only when (a) you have a recent restic backup, (b) you trust the
secrets at the time of the snapshot, and (c) you want to come back up
faster than path A. Note: secrets in the restic snapshot are server-side
artifacts (rendered configs); the canonical source is still the SOPS
file.

```bash
# 1. Provision a fresh VPS
$EDITOR terraform/providers/upcloud/environments/prod.tfvars
make init plan apply inventory wait

# 2. Push baseline + firewall + backup role only (gets restic installed)
ANSIBLE_TAGS="baseline,firewall,backup" \
ansible-playbook ansible/playbooks/site.yml --tags "baseline,firewall,backup"

# 3. Push the restic password (already in your secrets file)
make decrypt

# 4. Copy restic repo from old backup target — this depends on where you sync
#    restic. Local-only repo means SCP from a forensic snapshot of the old
#    disk. Operators with remote restic targets (S3, BorgBase, etc.) point
#    the new VPS at the same target.

# 5. Restore configs
ssh deploy@<new-vps>
sudo restic -r /var/backups/vpn-restic --password-file /etc/restic/password \
    restore latest --target /

# 6. Reconcile with Ansible (may show drift — investigate before accepting)
make dry-run

# 7. If drift is acceptable / expected, deploy to overwrite restored files
#    with template-rendered ones from current secrets:
make deploy
make verify
make clean
```

Do not hand-repair a snowflake server. Path A is the default. Path B
exists for the "I need to be live in 15 minutes and have a known-good
restic snapshot" case.

## Backup verification (recurring task)

The `backup` role runs a daily restic snapshot. Verify quarterly:

```bash
ssh deploy@<vps>
sudo restic -r /var/backups/vpn-restic --password-file /etc/restic/password snapshots
sudo restic -r /var/backups/vpn-restic --password-file /etc/restic/password \
    restore latest --target /tmp/restic-test --dry-run
```

If `--dry-run` errors, the backup is corrupt. Investigate before you
need it.

## Backup repository leak

If you suspect the restic repository itself is compromised (e.g., the
remote target was breached, or the password leaked):

1. Treat every secret in the snapshots as compromised — the snapshots
   contain rendered configs with REALITY private keys, Hysteria certs,
   AWG private keys.
2. Rotate everything per `RUNBOOK-rotate.md` levels 2–4.
3. Re-init the repo with a new password (see `RUNBOOK-rotate.md` § 4).

## RTO / RPO targets

- **RPO** (data loss tolerance): up to 24 hours (daily restic snapshot).
  Lower if you sync remote more often.
- **RTO** (time to recover): 15–30 minutes for path A on a pre-funded
  provider account. Add provider-account-creation time if you don't have
  a sub-account already.

If your operational target is tighter than 30 minutes RTO, you should be
running multi-VPS already. See `RUNBOOK-add-fallback.md`.
