# terraform — cloud resource layer

## Design decisions

**Per-provider root, identical outputs** — Terraform module sources can't
be variable-driven, so each provider gets its own root under
`providers/<name>/`. Output schema is fixed: `server_ipv4`, `server_ipv6`,
`admin_user`, `server_hostname`. `scripts/render-inventory.sh` is therefore
provider-neutral.

**Local state by default** — we don't trust remote state with VPN
infrastructure. Backed up via `make backup-state` (age-encrypted).
Lose state → re-import (`docs/RUNBOOK-restore.md`).

**No `local-exec` / `remote-exec`** — Terraform stays declarative.
cloud-init owns first-boot bootstrap; Ansible owns runtime state.

**Floating IP is optional** — `var.use_floating_ip` per provider. Cheap
operators skip it; blue-green operators turn it on.

## What's done well

- **Validation blocks on every input** — region, plan, CIDR, key formats
  all validated at plan time, not apply time.
- **Outputs are minimal** — only what the Ansible layer needs. No
  back-channel information (e.g., no API keys in outputs).
- **No version constraint on the cloud provider** — pinned in
  `versions.tf` per provider root; major bumps go through staging.

## Pitfalls

- **TF state contains the SSH public key fingerprint**, but never the
  private key. If a state file leaks, the recovery is to rotate the SSH
  key, not just delete state.
- **Cloud-init `user_data` is plaintext in state** — never put secrets
  there. Even with state encryption, this is operator-readable.
- **`terraform destroy` does not remove backups** — the `backup` role's
  remote restic repo persists. Destroy + recreate gives you back state
  via `make restore`.
- **Provider auth via env vars only** — never `provider` block credentials
  in code. The block must be empty (the provider auto-reads env).
- **`tf-test`** uses `mock_provider`** — these tests verify the *shape*
  of plans, not that the cloud provider behaves correctly. Real-deploy
  validation is separate (`docs/CI-REAL-DEPLOY.md`).
