# terraform/providers/vultr — tertiary provider

## Design decisions

**Same output schema as upcloud + hetzner** — provider-neutral inventory.

**Plan + region constraints** — `vc2-1c-1gb` / `vhf-1c-1gb` only; restricted
to AMS / FRA / LHR for low-latency RU paths.

## What's done well

- **`backups_enabled = false`** — Vultr's built-in backups can store unencrypted
  snapshots. The `backup` role owns this via restic+age instead.

## Pitfalls

- **Vultr API rate limit is tight** — bulk `terraform apply` across many hosts
  hits 429s. Use `-parallelism=2`.
- **Floating IP is global, not regional** — but attachment is regional. Don't
  assume regional FIPs.
- **DDoS protection IPs flag VPN traffic** — never enable Vultr's "DDoS
  Protection" add-on; it routes through Vultr-owned scrubbers that inspect
  TLS metadata.
- **Vultr ASN (20473) is a heavily-flagged VPN exit** — same caveat as
  Hetzner; lean harder on REALITY camouflage + cohort tuning here.
