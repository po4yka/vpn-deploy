"""Unit tests for scripts/scan-reality-targets.sh.

The script wraps a third-party binary (RealiTLScanner) that cannot be stubbed
via PATH (the script resolves it by an absolute cached path, not via PATH).
Tests here cover the argument-validation and early-exit paths that fire before
the binary is invoked.  The actual scan logic is exercised in CI where the
binary can be downloaded; those paths are skipped locally with a clear reason.
