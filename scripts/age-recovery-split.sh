# Usage:

# Output: shares printed to stdout. Each share goes to a different

IMPORTANT:
  - Hand each share to a *different* storage location. Anyone holding T
    shares can reconstruct the full key.
  - Do NOT screenshot the terminal. Do NOT paste into chat.
  - To reconstruct: scripts/age-recovery-combine.sh
  - Test the reconstruction NOW, before you need it. See docs/AGE-RECOVERY.md.
